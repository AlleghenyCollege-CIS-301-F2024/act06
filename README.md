# An analysis of penguins features in population

## Assigned: 25th October 2024

## Due 25th October 2024, __by end of class__

---

## Learning Objectives

- Following code for Linear regression
- Creating models and assess goodness
- Interpreting results

## Instructions

As a class, we will be completing the code in the `src/penguinAnalysis.R`. Follow along and write the code from the instructor. 

Once you have spent time studying the code and its results, please address the questions the File `writing/reflection.md`.

## Project Assessment

This is a check mark grade.

## GatorGrade Checking

You can also use `gatorgrade` to check the baseline requirements of this assignment by running the following command in your terminal:

`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`

If `gatorgrade` shows that all checks pass, you will know that you have met baseline requirements of this project.

After you have pushed your work to your repository, please visit the repository at the GitHub website (you may have to log-in using your browser) to verify that your files were correctly sent.

### Installing GatorGrade

- First, [install `pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/)
- Then, install `gatorgrade` with `pipx install gatorgrade`
You might also want to install VsCode to help you edit code as text files.
- Install `VSCode` or another editor that will come in handy when working with code in textfiles. See [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) for details on installing this editor.

## Seeking Assistance

Students who have questions about this project outside of the class or lab time are invited to ask them in the course's Discord channel or during instructor's or TL's office hours.
